### Initiatives

--- Blended Language Approach (B.L.A.)

Innovated by our founder, the Blended Language Approach combines phonics and whole language strategies to enhance children's reading proficiency and comprehension. Through a pilot initiative with students in grades 4-6, we observed remarkable results: within six months of implementation, 80% of students achieved significant progress in their reading levels.

--- Socio Emotional Learning

AVP acknowledges the significance of students' mental well-being, prioritizing their socio-emotional development. To support this, we conduct dedicated sessions on socio-emotional learning, empowering students to effectively manage and regulate their emotions for overall well-being.

---Project Pineers

Project Pioneers represents an innovative project-based curriculum tailored specifically for the Indian context. Its primary objective is to equip children with essential 21st-century skills, ensuring that education remains pertinent amidst the rapid transformations in the economic landscape. This curriculum fosters the development of communication, critical thinking, confidence, and other vital competencies, while also imparting academic knowledge.

At AVP, we are actively engaged in the development and implementation of this curriculum, and early indicators suggest promising outcomes

--- Digital Literacy

Digital literacy is an indispensable skill in the 21st century, crucial for success in today's world. Unfortunately, many students miss out on higher education opportunities simply because they lack exposure to computers. Collaborating with our partners at Computer Shiksha, we have initiated digital literacy training starting from grade 1, ensuring that our students are well-prepared for the future.

--- The Buddy Project

The Buddy Project strives to cultivate compassion among students by fostering inter-grade interactions. Students in primary grades take on the role of mentors, assisting younger peers in nursery and kindergarten with various activities. This not only instills in them values like responsibility, patience, and compassion but also provides an enjoyable learning experience for the younger ones as they benefit from the guidance of their older buddies.
